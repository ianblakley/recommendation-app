# Spotify Recommendation Web App

A web app I created using Python, Flask, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and Google's new Project IDX IDE.

## Background

The site leverages user Spotify data via the [Spotipy Python Library](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.24.0/) and the [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api) to generate song recommendations and show the user's top listened to songs and artists. I decided to make this project so I could improve my skills of using Python for web development and learning how to present user data in an interesting and creative way.
